\section{Q2) Mass-Radius relation} % (fold)
\label{sec:q2_mass_radius_relation}
\questiontext{Sketch a plot of radius versus mass for various ``cold" objects made of normal matter, including brown dwarfs and white dwarfs.  How does composition affect the curve? Why is there an upper mass limit?}\\

Notes:\\
Do you need to overcome electron degeneracy pressure in order for fusion to happen?\\
Are gas giants supported by electron degeneracy pressure?\\
Why don't we use the ideal gas law for the equation of state of gas giants?\\


Follow-up: what happens on the diagram when we move from cold objects to stars?\\
Follow-up: what if the objects have heat? (So far we have assumed that Temperature is negligible). How do we account for radiation? Magnetic fields can "puff up" object.
Follow-up: gradient in T, element, phase of matter, radiation from host star. There are still some mystery planets!
